  <h1>Audition</h1>

  <p>Hey there! Birdstrike Theatre is always needing new, awesome people to do improv with.
Auditions take a lot of time, though, and we like to focus on team building throughout the year,
so we audition <strong>once a year</strong> in <strong>fall</strong> quarter.
If you can&#39;t make the auditions, sorry, you&#39;ll have to audition the following year.</p>

<p>For this year&#39;s audition days and times, see the <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">The Process</h2>

<p>We generally have two days for auditions, but just come to <em>one</em>.
We split it up into two days to help ensure people can make at least one day as well as to give
  everyone more stage time.
Each audition session is usually 2 hours.</p>

<p>We also like to spend some time getting to know people a little bit better outside of
  improvisation, so we&#39;ll ask you to sign up for a quick 15 minute interview around the time
  of auditions.
If you haven&#39;t spoken with us during our MU tabling or at the workshop to set up an interview
  time please <a href="mailto:ucdbirdstriketheatre@gmail.com">email us</a> and we&#39;ll set up a time.</p>

<p>The people from auditions we need to see more of to make a decision will be
  invited to <em>callbacks</em>, which occurs soon after auditions.
This gives you another opportunity to bring your A-game if you feel you didn&#39;t do your best
  during your first audition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we don&#39;t have room to let everyone who auditions into Birdstrike.
There are many wonderful, talented, awesome people we utterly love who just don&#39;t make it in
  for whatever reason.
Don&#39;t be discouraged- get involved in other improv groups and watch Birdstrike shows to see how we
  work together. We encourage you to audition the following year, as a number of
  us have gotten in the second time around!</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Summary</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to do to audition:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Interview</em>: a quick, informal interview so we can get to know you a little better. Set a time at the workshop or by emailing us.</li>
<li><em>Audition</em>: come to <em>1</em> of the two audition times.</li>
<li><em>Callbacks</em>: some people we need to see a bit more of to make a decision. Callbacks will occur later on the same day as the last day of auditions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_2">What We Look For</h2>

<p>First off, <em>no prior improv experience is necessary</em>.
We look for people who are fun, playful and creative.
People who support their scene partners and make them look good.
We do long form improv, so we&#39;re not necessarily looking for quick, jokey players, but rather people
  who can embrace characters and do deeper, situational humor.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t done improv before don&#39;t be scared, just come, have fun and play with us!</p>
